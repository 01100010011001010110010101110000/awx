Local versions of third-party packages required by Tower.  Package names and
versions are listed below, along with notes on which files are included.

# Questions ...
#stevedore==1.3.0 (Doesn't seem to be used by us, included in requirements.txt anyway .. may be a dependency)
#distribute==0.7.3 (no files)
#rackspace-novaclient==1.4 (no files)
#pip==1.5.4 (pip/*, excluded bin/pip*)

# Packages that weren't in README and couldn't easily decern the versions
* pkg_resources
* winrm
    * isodate

# Manually added after .. maybe dev stuff ?
pycrypto
psycopg2
pyzmq


Note: consider removing python-pip from Dockerfile dev

Note: lib/compat.py seems to be needed .. why ?



* I put pip and distribute in jenkins instead of the referenced Makefile. Should these also be in prodouction?
