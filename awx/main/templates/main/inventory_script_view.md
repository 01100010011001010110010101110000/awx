Generate inventory group and host data as needed for an inventory script.

Refer to [External Inventory Scripts](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/api.html#external-inventory-scripts)
for more information on inventory scripts.

## List Response

Make a GET request to this resource without query parameters to retrieve a JSON
object containing groups, including the hosts, children and variables for each
group.  The response data is equivalent to that returned by passing the
`--list` argument to an inventory script.

_(New in AWX 1.3)_ Specify a query string of `?hostvars=1` to retrieve the JSON
object above including all host variables.  The `['_meta']['hostvars']` object
in the response contains an entry for each host with its variables.  This
response format can be used with Ansible 1.3 and later to avoid making a
separate API request for each host.  Refer to
[Tuning the External Inventory Script](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/api.html#tuning-the-external-inventory-script)
for more information on this feature.

## Host Response

Make a GET request to this resource with a query string similar to
`?host=HOSTNAME` to retrieve a JSON object containing host variables for the
specified host.  The response data is equivalent to that returned by passing
the `--host HOSTNAME` argument to an inventory script.
